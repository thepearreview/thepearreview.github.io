# #25 : Striving for the common good in times of COVID | Ethics & Theology Prof. Douglas Farrow 

We are joined again by Professor Douglas Farrow of McGill University to discuss his latest article: "Whether there is a moral obligation to disobey the coercive mandates". We cover a wide range of topics, from the role of science in modern society and our search for meaning, to the moral implications of civil disobedience in the context of COVID.
