# #29 : Tackling the Data Double Spend | Dr. Victoria Lemieux & Meng Kang of UBC 

Meng Kang and Prof. Victoria Lemieux work at the University of British Columbia Blockchiain Research Cluster. The work they presented is from their recent Ledger Journal article which proposes a blockchain protocol designed to prevent re-use of private data while allowing for data provides to monetize their information. That is, if you provide your data for example to 23andme to receive genetic analysis, tools that prevent data double spend would then prevent 23andme from then re-using the same data for other purposes without your knowledge or without your benefiting from the resale.
