# #23 : Equivariant Neural Nets for DNA & Group Theory | First Author, Vincent Mallet, NeurIPS 2021 

Vincent Mallet from Institut Pasteur and Les Mines in Paris presents his NeurIPS 2021 paper which establishes a theoretical and practical framework for building neural nets that are equivariant to DNA reverse complementarity. Equi-RC shows state of the art performance on protein binding prediction tasks.
