# #27 : Risk-benefit analysis for COVID vaccination | Professor Spiro Pantazatos, Columbia U 

Dr. Spiro Pantazatos, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Neurobiology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. He has a background and training in clinical informatics, neuroimaging, and biomedical data science. In this video, Dr. Pantazatos walks us through his recent analysis of age stratified mortality and its association with regional variations in vaccine rollout. This work is meant to complement adverse effect reporting systems and clinical studies and derive data-driven estimates of all-cause mortality risk in order to quantitatively assess the risk-benefit relationship of vaccination for various age groups.

Note: The work discussed here is based on a preprint that has not yet undergone peer review and publication. Critical and constructive feedback and comments are welcome in the comment section, as well as on the article link (above). Please read the manuscript draft before commenting.
