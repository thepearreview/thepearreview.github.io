# #28 : RNA & The Natural Universal Computer | Dr. Hessam Akhlaghpour 

Dr. Hessam Akhlaghpour is a postdoctoral researcher at Rockefeller University where he studies path integration in flies and the underlying mechanisms of memory.
His most recent work, 'And RNA-based theory of natural universal computation' is an elegant theoretical work which combines the fields of theoretical computer science and molecular biology to propose a plausible mechanism by which molecules can achieve universal computation.
